- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** — offers a ready-to-use platform for application development and deployment.  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** — provides access to software on a subscription basis.  

## Advantages  

- Scalability and flexibility of resources.  
- Reduction of infrastructure and maintenance costs.  
- Availability of services from anywhere in the world.  
- Support for collaboration and system integration.  

## Challenges and Risks  

- Ensuring data security and confidentiality.  
- Dependence on internet connectivity and service providers.  
- Compliance with legal regulations and standards.  

## Conclusion  

Cloud computing is transforming the approach to IT infrastructure management and business processes. This technology continues to evolve, opening new opportunities for science, education, and the commercial sector. Knowledge of cloud solutions has become an essential skill for IT professionals and related fields.
