## Introduction  

Version control is a fundamental tool in modern software development. Version Control Systems (VCS) allow developers to track changes in code, coordinate teamwork, and maintain a full project history.  

## Key Concepts  

- **Repository** — a storage location containing the code and its full history of changes.  
- **Commit** — a recorded change in the codebase.  
- **Branching** — a mechanism of parallel development that enables the creation of independent lines of work.  
- **Merging** — the process of combining changes from different branches.  

## Popular Tools  

The most widely used version control system today is **Git**, often paired with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Other systems, such as Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial, are less common but still used in some projects.  

## Advantages of VCS  

- Ability to restore previous versions of a project.  
- Support for teamwork and parallel development.  
- Tracking of change history and authorship.  
- Simplification of integration and deployment processes.  

## Conclusion  

Version control systems have become an essential element of software engineering. Their use ensures development reliability, process transparency, and effective team collaboration. Proficiency with tools like Git is a vital skill for every developer.
